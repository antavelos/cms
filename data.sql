The Bruxellois is considered one of the greatest cartoonists of all time. The drawing is an enlargement of the 56th illustration from Tintin in America. Tintin is not travelling on the locomotive to avoid paying his fare. The goody-goody but very brave boy would never do that kind of thing. He is in the middle of chasing after Billy Smiles. This gangster is after Tintin because he refuses to kill the notorious Al Capone. Tintin in America is the third album from the famous series by Hergé and dates from 1932. A long time ago perhaps, but Tintin has never ceased to enthral readers young and old, all over the world. Hergé''s unparalleled, timeless graphic style has a lot to do with that. The original drawings attract big money at art auctions these days. But the comic was a phenomenon because of Tintin''s lively and exciting adventures in every corner of the globe. The hero with the funny quiff is a relatively colourless and anonymous figure. We never get to know his age, full name and family situation. But this neutrality makes him at home everywhere and enables everyone to identify with him.

Initially, the cartoon had a permanent slot, but later on Le Chat was used more as a disruptive element, turning up in unexpected places in the newspaper. The drawing style is simple, sober and efficient, which focuses attention on what Le Chat has to say. He does not live for applause but chuckles whenever he manages to briefly perplex readers. Something which he primarily achieves by way of absurd or philosophic remarks or jokes about apparently trivial matters, seen from a very different angle. He does not aim for belly laughs, a chuckle will do nicely. The first album that combines the best jokes came out in 1986 and was a great success. Le Chat is also the self-portrait of Geluck. ''But that''s particularly the case when he says something intelligent and doesn''t appear stupid", he jests. By and large, cartoonists are too shy to compete with the fame of their characters but Geluck is the exception. Innumerable radio and TV programmes in Belgium and France have made him famous.

The seven year-old boy, who is as honest as the day is long, savours life with an infectious appetite and is usually accompanied by his best friend fat Louis, the Tarzan who is testing the strength of the lamp on the mural. As he doesn''t have a Mum, Jojo lives with his grandma or Mamy, in a place where the city meets the countryside. The place where Jojo''s overworked dad lives is a more built-up and modern environment. The vague date is no coincidence. The artist André Geerts who died young (1955-2010) was not ashamed of a touch of nostalgia or romance. With recognisable scenes of everyday life, he tried to reconstruct a lost paradise. He combined his talent for spotting these small but priceless moments with a drawing style that was both dynamic and fragile, with lots of curves and pastel colours.

The humorous adventure series has no hesitation in involving historical characters (Edith Piaf, Hitler, Laurel & Hardy, John Wayne,...) and events, something which requires a lot of research. Odilon Verjus is a grumpy grumbler who is not best pleased that the Vatican keeps taking him away from his beloved Papua to lumber him with yet another secret mission. But actually, he is generosity itself. Don''t take any notice of the austere white beard and dress code: his knowledge of Papuan curses and coarse songs has led to quite a few red ears.

The characters enjoyed their first adventures between 1939 and 1942 in Catholic magazine Petits Belges. They were invented by Joseph Gillain (1914 -1980), known as Jijé. The godfather and pioneer of the Belgian comic strip began working in 1939 at the newly launched Spirou magazine. He took over the Spirou series from Frenchman Rob-Vel and introduced Fantasio. He brought Jean Valhardi to life and drew American comic strips when the supply dried up during the Second World War. After the war, Spirou magazine flourished. The magazine''s mainstay Jijé brought in one great talent after another: Will, Morris, Eddy Paape and Franquin. In 1950, Jijé started his Jerry Spring western series and, as a devout Catholic, he produced a biography of Baden-Powell and Don Bosco. Ten years later, he took over Tanguy and Laverdure from Albert Uderzo and Redbeard from Victor Hubinon. The gifted artist could handle any genre. He also immediately realised how great Franquin''s Marsupilami was, and in ''Blondin and Cirage discover the Flying Saucers'', he came up with a variant.

Their adventures are not set all over the world but in the Marolles, the Brussels quarter where Hergé grew up. The two kids are just one year younger than Tintin. They played their first comic strip pranks in 1930 in Le Petit Vingtième, the children''s supplement of Le Siècle Vingtième where Tintin also made his debut. The strips consist of several humorous stories of one or two pages, with or without text.

This works better if you already visited Brussels. The Palace of the Three Powers in Brüsel is the Palais de Justice building designed by architect Poelaert.

Gifted artist Albert Uderzo and brilliant writer René Goscinny met in Brussels. Before Asterix, they worked together on the Indian comic strip Hoempa Pa. After Goscinny''s death in 1977, Uderzo continued Asterix on his own. He wants the series to live on after his death too.

Cynicism is a fixture in his work. Rather than remaining indifferent, Hermann confronts his readers with the terrible things that petty, selfish and power-hungry people do to each other. Above all, he is one of those exceptions who is both an excellent artist and a gifted storyteller. Hermann Huppen broke through with the Bernard Prince adventure comic strip, drew the first albums of Jugurtha and in 1969, began working with writer Greg on Comanche to begin a legendary western series. In 1977, he dumped Bernard Prince for his own series: Jeremiah. The title hero is a loner who tries to be a good person in a post-apocalyptic Far West that brings out the worst in people. One-shots like Sarajevo Tango and Caatinga confirmed his place in the firmament of European comic strips. Plenty of famous strips and characters, but who did this merciless chronicler of human misconduct choose to decorate a blank wall in Brussels? A boy in pyjamas with a fertile imagination and a talent for dreaming. In the early ''80s, Hermann drew three albums featuring Nick. Every night, he has fun adventures in the company of an elephant, a chimpanzee, a giraffe, a hippo, a turtle or a whale, but the adventures do not always turn out well.

The bricked-up windows and the relief of the wall were a challenge for the artist and the other members of the team. They made the best of the limitations in situ.

In this album, megalomaniac inventor Septimus has the ubiquitous villain Olrik under his control, and gives him seemingly supernatural powers.

They are not afraid of time travel, mysterious pyramids and mad professors who control the weather either. Leaving aside the unusual use of colour, Jacobs adopts a highly realistic graphical approach.

The comic strip mural in the unobtrusive rue d''Ophem is a beacon of light and optimism. Billy the Cat appeared in 1981 in Spirou comic strip magazine but really only began his career in 1987. Its strength lies in the cheerful, polished drawings of Liege artist Stéphane Colman and the tone adopted by the American-Brussels writer Stephen Desberg. The series is part of the glorious tradition of the elegant Belgian children''s comic strip that secretly delights many adults too. Living in the street is not easy, but luckily Billy not only has enemies but also a motley crew of friends such as the fat Sausage, Jumbo the Pigeon, Mister Hubert and Miss Cha-cha. The fact that the cat is actually a reincarnation of a boy, and the fact that he would like to return to normality, offers quite a range of possibilities. Other comic strips and ambitions prevented Colman and Desberg from taking it further. At the start of this century, the series was taken over by Liège cartoonist Peral. Billy the Cat is the star of an international cartoon film series. Comic strip and TV series take very different views of the origins of the transformation of boy into cat. In the strip cartoon, the brat Billy crosses the street without looking, and is reincarnated as a cat. The TV series makers were concerned that children would throw themselves in front of cars in the hope of turning into a cuddly cat.

Suzy''s rag doll plays a key role in several adventures. Suzy is the girl with the egg-shaped head, in the white dress and with a bow in her hair. A headstrong damsel, Suzy has not stopped adventuring since 1945. She is ably assisted by the brave Spike. The fair-haired beanpole is nervous Aunt Sidonia. Although Ambrose looks quite respectable and straightforward in the mural, in actual fact he is a dunce, who often causes uproar, but is always good for a laugh. Jethro is a gentle muscleman. Spike and Suzy is the undisputed number one among Flemish family comic strips. In Flanders, Kiekeboe by Merho sells better, but thanks to The Netherlands and French-speaking Belgium, Spike and Suzy is still the best-selling comic series in the Benelux.

But God is relying on this specimen of the human species to restore some order, superhero-style, at the start of the twentieth century. God has bet Lincoln that one day he will finally find happiness. Just to make sure, he has made the cynical cowboy immortal. If there is a fight, God prefers to remain aloof. On the mural, he is looking on from the first floor, surrounded by angels with harps. Two doors down, his eternal adversary the devil is seen sporting a grin. The original concept was developed in a series of exciting adventures, topped with pithy humour. Lincoln is able to put his mostly pessimistic view of the world into words with sharp wit.','lincoln-BIG.png','lincoln-SMALL.png');

Deriving his name from the egghead, "petit oeuf" was corrupted into Titeuf. But it is thanks to his proud, rebellious straw yellow crest that everyone immediately recognises him wherever he goes. It is not unlikely his behaviour has something to do with that as well. Look at the comic strip mural. Is Titeuf on a school trip to the globes of the Atomium in Brussels and checking in the convex mirror to see if his hair is alright? Or was it an attempt to spy on the girls from the air? With a cheeky show-off, you never know. His jokes, tricks and caprices have tremendous appeal for young readers. With print runs exceeding 1.5 million, Titeuf qualifies as a phenomenon. The comic strip hero has his own animated series, computer games and wallpaper and made it onto the cinema screens in 2011. His spiritual father is a Led Zeppelin fan who disproves the cliché that the Swiss have no humour. Although his real name is Philippe Chappuis when he goes to the bank, he answers to Zep when he is signing comic strips. Titeuf is a humorous comic but doesn''t only contain jokes. There is still room for emotion, amazement and tenderness. The guy speaks like a real child and not the way older people think that children speak. His adventures don''t take place on distant planets but in the playground, the classroom, at home or on the way to school. His imagination does the rest. He is convinced that his ageing teacher is an extraterrestrial. By seeing the absurd grown-up world through the eyes of Titeuf, you will split your sides laughing.

This is how proud publisher Jean Dupuis described the hero of the same name as his legendary comic magazine: Spirou. Spirou was first written by French artist Rob-Vel, but was later taken over by others artists, the best known of whom are Jijé (1943-1946) and André Franquin (1946-1968). Today the comic strip is in the hands of Morvan and Munuera. But between 1981 and 1998, Spirou was handled by Tome and Janry. The pair got to know each other when they were just known as Richard Vandevelde and Jean-Philippe Geurts. In 1983, they brought out a special issue with a gag about Spirou''s childhood. Little Spirou was born. He is definitely not an incorruptible hero of unimpeachable character, but more of a cheeky rascal with a rather premature, naive interest in sex and an unbridled imagination. Characteristics that do not do him any favours when he is repeatedly the victim of incomprehensible and sometimes weird teachers. The new series was a hit. Drawings are carefully produced, the good humour and the sweet, slightly nostalgic atmosphere can last for another few years. The carousel on the comic strip mural at Bruparck has a few turns to go, much to the delight of Little Spirou''s maths teacher. Teacher Miss Claudia Chiffre is the amazon who dads tend to stare at.','le_petit_spirou-BIG.png','le_petit_spirou-SMALL.png');

Very long and hard indeed. His wife Charlotte shows off the clothes of the legendary trade fair hostesses of the 1958 World Exhibition which catapulted Brussels into the modern age. Son Konstantinopel wants to be an ace reporter. The babe in the elegant ''50s dress who is keeping up a hula hoop is Marcel''s daughter. Fanny has already turned many men''s heads. Not least when she posed nude on the cover of a Flemish men''s magazine. The Kiekeboes are a typical example of a Flemish family comic strip and in terms of sales even manage to give Spike and Suzy a run for their money. Each new album sells a hundred thousand copies. A clear story is always seasoned with a healthy dose of good-natured humour. There is no shortage of puns and parodies. The series debuted on 15 February 1977 in Het Laatste Nieuws daily newspaper. In 2004, Gazet van Antwerpen and Het Belang van Limburg took over Kiekeboe. To supply the newspaper with new strips daily, in the same way Willy Vandersteen, Marc Sleen and Jef Nys had done before him, Merho had to work at a hellish pace. Merho, the alias of Robert Merhottein, drew his first Marcel Kiekeboe for his brother, an avid puppet show performer. Even children in the last row had to be able to recognise the puppet easily, hence the big nose, big eyes and huge moustache. The half-bald head fits back perfectly in the tradition of Lambic and Nero. ','kiekeboe-BIG.png','kiekeboe-SMALL.png');

In the passenger''s seat we see Libellule (Dragonfly), known for his special sense of humour, in this case recognisable by his yellow hat and cigarette. Libellule is an ex-burglar who assists the sometimes arrogant detective with varying degrees of success. The charming adventures are built around an exciting plot involving action, witty dialogue, a pinch of mystery and humour. Gil Jourdan solved his first case in Spirou magazine in 1956. But actually Maurice Tillieux (1922 -1978) was embroidering a character he had previously drawn for the weekly Héroic albums: the red-haired, bespectacled journalist Felix. At the end of the ''60s, Tillieux handed the drawing work over to Gos so he could focus more on coming up with scenarios for Will (Beard and Bald), Roba (The Swarm), Walthéry (Natacha) and Roger Leloup (Yoko Tsuno). He devised one comic strip after another under various pseudonyms. It is no coincidence that the mural is dominated by a rugged sailor. Tillieux was a seaman but the Second World War nipped his naval career in the bud. The joke with the danger sign warning of a straight line is a bit macabre. After having dreamed up and drawn countless car crashes, Tillieux died in a car accident.','gil_jourdan-BIG.png','gil_jourdan-SMALL.png');

Comanche and Yoko Tsuno followed fairly quickly but it was Natacha who broke the mould in 1970. We''re not supposed to tell you that she''s blonde, blessed with voluptuous curves and looks great in uniform. All you need to do is look at the mural. But don''t stop at her appearance. The stewardess is not a dumb blonde but an intelligent woman who knows what she wants and is keen to retain her independence. The resolute lady knows how to keep her composure in an emergency and is unafraid to answer back if offended. She can also be quite stubborn and like all true comic strip heroes, she has a highly developed sense of justice. Most of her adventures are somehow related to air travel. The man on the mural sweating as he drags two red suitcases dragging, is Walter. The clumsy jazz lover would like more than her friend, colleague and fellow adventurer, but that is unlikely. Natacha is the character with which Walloon artist Francois Walthéry is closely associated. Walthéry was only seventeen when he became the assistant of Peyo, the creator of The Smurfs. In the late ''60s, he took over Peyo''s drawing work for Steven Sterk. He doesn''t like rush jobs. Over a period of forty years, just over twenty albums have been published. There are both classic adventure comic strips which are in the thriller or science fiction genre. Walthéry worked with a dozen different writers. Fortunately, Natacha has kept her looks after all that time.','natacha-BIG.png','natacha-SMALL.png');
